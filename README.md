# SingPong
Sing Pong is an Android app based on the original 'Pong' game.
The twist is that the players' paddles are positioned by the pitch at which they sing/shout.

## Project Status
This project is very early in its development. As such it is in no way functional as a game.

## Installation
Cloning this repo should allow you to build an Android Studio project, although this is completely untested.
